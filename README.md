# Learn to code

A little repo I can use to help my kids learn how to write software

## Installing

To install required dependencies, run `npm i` from this directory after cloning it

## Running tests

A lot of the lessons are taught using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework.
Tests can be run in two modes

- Run once: `npm test`
- Run in `watch` mode: `npm run test:watch`
